AWS pricing model
Three fundamental drivers of cost with AWS
Compute Storage Data transfer
• Charged per hour/second* • Charged typically per GB • Outbound is aggregated
and charged
• Varies by instance type
• Inbound has no charge
(with some exceptions)
*Linux only • Charged typically per GB
There are three fundamental drivers of cost with AWS: compute, storage, and outbound data
transfer. These characteristics vary somewhat, depending on the AWS product and pricing model
you choose.
In most cases, there is no charge for inbound data transfer or for data transfer between other
AWS services within the same AWS Region. There are some exceptions,so be sure to verify data
transfer rates before you begin to use the AWS service.
Outbound data transfer is aggregated across services and then charged at the outbound data
transfer rate. This charge appears on the monthly statement as AWS Data Transfer Out.
=== Page 9 ===
How do you pay for AWS?
This philosophy is what underlies AWS pricing. While the number and types of services offered by
AWS have increased dramatically, our philosophy on pricing has not changed. At the end of each
month, you pay for what you use. You can start or stop using a product at any time. No long-term
contracts are required.
AWS offers a range of cloud computing services. For each service, you pay for exactly the amount
of resources that you actually need. This utility-style pricing model includes:
• Pay for what you use
• Pay less when you reserve
• Pay less when you use more
• Pay even less as AWS grows
You will now take a closer look at these core concepts of pricing.
To learn more about AWS pricing,seethe AWS pricing overview at
https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/aws_pricing_overview.pdf.
=== Page 10 ===
Pay for what you use
Pay only for the services that you consume, with no
large upfront expenses.
On premises AWS
Unless you build data centers for a living, you might have spent too much time and money
building them. With AWS, you pay only for the services that you consume with no large upfront
expenses. You can lower variable costs, so you no longer need to dedicate valuable resources to
building costly infrastructure, including purchasing servers, software licenses, or leasing facilities.
Quickly adapt to changing business needs and redirect your focus on innovation and invention by
paying only for what you use and for as long as you need it. All AWS services are available on
demand, require no long-term contracts, and have no complex licensing dependencies.
=== Page 11 ===
Pay less when you reserve
Invest in Reserved
Instances (RIs):
• Save up to 75 percent
• Options:
EC2
• All Upfront Reserved instance
Instance (AURI) →
largest discount
• Partial Upfront
NURI PURI AURI
Reserved Instance
(PURI) →lower
discounts
• No Upfront Payments
Reserved Instance
(NURI) →smaller
discount
For certain services like AmazonElastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and Amazon Relational
Database Service (Amazon RDS), you can invest in reserved capacity. With Reserved Instances,
you can save up to 75 percent over equivalent on-demand capacity. Reserved Instances are
available in three options:
• All Upfront Reserved Instance (or AURI)
• Partial Upfront Reserved Instance (or PURI)
• No Upfront Payments Reserved Instance (or NURI)
When you buy Reserved Instances, youreceive a greater discount when you make alarger
upfront payment. To maximize your savings, you can pay all upfront and receive the largest
discount. Partial Upfront RIs offer lower discounts, but they give you the option to spend less
upfront. Lastly, you can choose to spend nothing upfront and receive a smaller discount, which
enables you to free capital to spend on other projects.
By using reserved capacity, your organization can minimize risks, more predictably manage
budgets, and comply with policies that require longer-term commitments.
=== Page 12 ===
Pay less by using more
Realize volume-based discounts:
• Savings as usage increases.
• Tiered pricing for services like Amazon
Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3),
Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon
EBS), or Amazon Elastic File System
(Amazon EFS) → the more you use, the
less you pay per GB.
• Multiple storage services deliver lower
storage costs based on needs.
With AWS, you can get volume-based discounts and realize important savings as your usage
increases. For services like Amazon Simple StorageService (Amazon S3), pricing is tiered, which
means that you pay less per GB when you use more. In addition, data transfer inis always free.
Multiple storage services deliver lower storage costs based on your needs. As a result, as your
AWS usage needs increase, you benefit from the economies of scale that enable you to increase
adoption and keep costs under control.
As your organization evolves, AWS also gives you options to acquire services that help you
address your business needs. For example, the AWS storage services portfolio offers options to
help you lower pricing based on how frequently you access data and the performance that you
need to retrieve it. To optimize your savings, you can choose the right combination of storage
solutions that help you reduce costs while preserving performance, security, and durability.
=== Page 13 ===
Pay even less as AWS grows
As AWS grows:
• AWS focuses on lowering cost of doing business.
• This practice results in AWS passing savings from
economies of scale to you.
• Since 2006, AWS has lowered pricing 75 times (as of
September 2019).
• Future higher-performing resources replace current
resources for no extra charge.
AWS constantly focuses on reducing data center hardware costs, improving operational
efficiencies, lowering power consumption, and generally lowering the cost of doing business.
These optimizations and the substantial and growing economies of scale of AWS result in passing
savings back to you as lower pricing. Since 2006, AWS has lowered pricing 75times (as of
September 2019).
Another benefit of AWS growth is that future, higher-performing resources replace current ones
for no extra charge.
=== Page 14 ===
Custom pricing
• Meet varying needs through custom pricing.
• Available for high-volume projects with unique
requirements.
AWS realizes that every customer has different needs. If none of the AWS pricing models work for
your project, custom pricing is available for high-volume projects with unique requirements.
=== Page 15 ===
AWS Free Tier
Enables you to gain free hands-on experience with the AWS
platform, products, and services. Free for 1 year for new
customers.
To help new AWS customers get started in the cloud, AWS offers a free usage tier (the AWS Free
Tier)for new customers for up to 1 year.The AWS Free Tier applies to certain services and
options. If youare a new AWS customer, you can run a free Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
(Amazon EC2) T2 micro instance for a year, while also using a free usage tier for Amazon S3,
Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS), Elastic Load Balancing, AWS data transfer, and other
AWS services.
To learn more, see AWS Free Tier at https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-

Services with no charge
Amazon VPC
Elastic Beanstalk**
Auto Scaling**
AWS CloudFormation**
AWS Identity and Access
**Note: There might be
Management (IAM)
charges associated with
other AWS services that are
used with these services.
AWS also offers a variety of services for no additional charge.
• Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)enables you to provision a logically isolated
section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you
define.
• AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)controls your users’ access to AWS services and
resources.
• Consolidated Billing is a billing feature in AWS Organizations to consolidate payment for
multiple AWS accounts or multiple Amazon Internet Services Private Limited (AISPL)
accounts*. Consolidated billing provides:
• One bill for multiple accounts.
• The ability to easily track each account’s charges.
• The opportunity to decrease charges as a result of volume pricing discounts from
combined usage.
• And you can consolidate all of your accounts using Consolidated Billing and get tiered
benefits.
• AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an even easier way for you to quickly deploy and manage applications
in the AWS Cloud.
• AWS CloudFormationgives developers and systems administrators an easy way to create a
collection of related AWS resources and provision them in an orderly and predictable fashion.
• Automatic Scalingautomatically adds or removes resources according to conditions you
define. The resources you are using increase seamlessly during demand spikes to maintain
performance and decrease automatically during demand lulls to minimize costs.
• AWS OpsWorks is an application management service that makes it easy to deploy and
operate applications of all shapes and sizes.
=== Page 17 ===
Though there is no charge for these services, there might be charges associated with other AWS
services used with these services. For example, when you automatically scale additional EC2
instances, there will be charges for those instances.
* Note: The main difference between AWS accounts and AISPL accounts is the seller of record. AWS
accounts are administered by Amazon Web Services, Inc., but AISPL accounts are administered by
Amazon Internet Services Private Limited. If you used an Indian address when you created your
account, your account's default seller of record is AISPL.By default, AISPL accounts are billed in
Indian Rupees (INR). See more on the seller of record here
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/manage-account-payment-
aispl.html#determine-seller.

Key takeaways • There is no charge (with some exceptions)
for:
• Inbound data transfer.
• Data transfer between services within the same
AWS Region.
• Pay for what you use.
• Start and stop anytime.
• No long-term contracts are required.
• Some services are free, but the other AWS
services that they provision might not be
free.
In summary, while the number and types of services offered by AWS have increased dramatically,
our philosophy on pricing has not changed. At the end of each month, you pay only for what you
use, and you can start or stop using a product at any time. No long-term contracts are required.
The best way to estimate costs is to examine the fundamental characteristics for each AWS
service, estimate your usage for each characteristic, and then map that usage to the prices that
are posted on the AWS website. The service pricing strategy gives you theflexibility to choose the
services that you need for each project and to pay only for what you use.
There are several free AWS services, including:
• Amazon VPC
• Elastic Beanstalk
• AWS CloudFormation
• IAM
• Automatic scalingservices
• AWS OpsWorks
• Consolidated Billing
While the services themselves are free, the resources that they provision might not be free. In
most cases, there is no charge for inbound data transfer or for data transfer between other AWS
services within the same AWS Region. There are some exceptions,so be sure to verify data
transfer rates before you begin to use the AWS service.
Outbound data transfer costs are tiered.

On-premises versus cloud

Scale up
Contracts Cost Self-service
and down
infrastructure
On-premises versus cloud is a question that many businesses ask. The difference between these
two options is how they are deployed.
An on-premises infrastructure is installed locally on a company’s own computers and servers.
There are several fixed costs, also known as capital expenses, that are associated with the
traditional infrastructure. Capital expenses include facilities, hardware, licenses, and maintenance
staff. Scaling up can be expensive and time-consuming. Scaling down does not reduce fixed costs.
A cloud infrastructure is purchased from a service provider who builds and maintains the
facilities, hardware, and maintenance staff. A customer pays for what is used. Scaling up or down
is simple. Costs are easy to estimate because they depend on service use.
It is difficult to compare an on-premises IT delivery model with the AWS Cloud. The two are
different because they use different concepts and terms.
Using on-premises IT involves a discussion that is based on capital expenditure, long planning
cycles, and multiple components to buy, build, manage, and refresh resources over time.
Using the AWS Cloud involves a discussion about flexibility, agility, and consumption-based costs.
So, how can you identify the best option?
=== Page 21 ===
What is Total ost of Ownership (TCO)?
Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) is the financial
estimate to help identify direct and indirect
costs of a system.
Why use TCO?
• To compare the costs of running an entire
infrastructure environment or specific
workload on-premises versus on AWS
• To budget and build the business case for
moving to the cloud
You can identify the best option by comparing the on-premises solution to a cloud solution. Total
Cost of Ownership (or TCO) is a financial estimate that is intended to help buyers and owners
determine the direct and indirect costs of a product or system. TCO includes the cost of a service,
plus all the costs that are associated with owning the service.
You might want to compare the costs of running an entire infrastructure environment for a
specific workload in an on-premises or collocation facility to the same workload running on a
cloud-based infrastructure. This comparison is done for budgeting purposes or to build a business
case for business decisions about the optimal deployment solution.
=== Page 22 ===
TCO considerations

Network hardware: Local area Facilities cost
3 Network Costs network (LAN) switches, load Network administration

4 IT Labor Costs Server administration costs
Some of the costs that are associated with data center management include:
• Servercosts for both hardware and software, and facilities costs to house the equipment.
• Storagecosts for the hardware, administration, and facilities.
• Networkcosts for hardware, administration, and facilities.
• And IT labor costs that are required to administer the entire solution.
When you compare an on-premises to cloud solution, it is important to accurately assess the true
costs of both options. With the cloud, most costs are upfront and readily calculated. For example,
cloud providers give transparent pricing based on different usage metrics, such as RAM, storage,
and bandwidth, among others. Pricing is frequently fixed per unit of time.
Customers gain certainty over pricing and are then able to readily calculate costs based on
several different usage estimates.
Compare this process to on-premises technology. Though they are sometimes difficult to
determine, calculations of in-house costs must take into account all:
• Direct costs that accompany running a server—like power, floor space, storage, and IT
operations to manage those resources.
• Indirect costs of running a server, like network and storage infrastructure.
=== Page 23 ===
This diagram is conceptual, and it does not include every cost item. For example, depending on the
solution you are implementing, software costs can include database, management, and middle-tier
costs. Facilities costs can include upgrades, maintenance, building security, taxes, and so on. IT labor
costs can include security administration and application administration costs. This diagramincludes
an abbreviated list to demonstrate the type of costs that are involved in data center maintenance.

On-Premises AWS
Here is a sample cost comparison. This example shows a cost comparison for an on-premises
solution and a cloud solution over 3 years. For this comparison, two similar environments were
constructed to represent the on-premises and AWS environments. Additional direct and indirect
costs that are associated with the on-premises solution were not included. The components of
the on-premises solution include:
• 1 virtual machine with 4 CPUs, 16 GB of RAM, and a Linux operating system
• Average utilization is 100 percent
• Optimized by RAM
The components of a comparable AWS environment include:
• 1 m4.xlarge instance with 4 CPUs, 16 GB of RAM
• The instance type is a 3-year Partial Upfront Reserved Instance
The on-premises 3-year total cost is $167,422. The AWS Cloud 3-year total cost is $7,509, which
is a 96 percent savings over the on-premises solution. Thus, the 3-year total savings on cloud
infrastructure would be $159,913. This comparison helps a business clearly understand the
differences between the alternatives.
What is the difference in the costs?
Remember, the on-premises solution is predicted. It continues to incur costs whether the
capacity is used.
=== Page 25 ===
In contrast, the AWS solution is commissioned when needed and decommissioned when the
resources are no longer in use, which results in lower overall costs.

Reading an estimate
Your estimate is broken into: first 12 months total, total upfront, and total monthly.
First 12 months total Total upfront Total monthly
AWS Pricing Calculator estimates are broken into:
• The total for your first 12 months –The total estimate for your current group and all of the
services and groups in your current group. It combines the upfront and monthly estimates.
• Your total upfront –How much you are estimated to pay upfront as you set up your AWS stack.
• Your total monthly –How much you're estimated to spend every month while you run your
AWS stack.
Within a group, you can see how much each service is estimated to cost. If you want to price out
different ways to build your AWS setup, you can use different groups for each variation of your
setup and compare the estimates for the different setups.

Additional benefit considerations
Hard benefits Soft Benefits
• Reuse of service and applications
• Reduced spending on compute,
that enable you to define (and
storage, networking, security
redefine solutions) by using the
• Reductions in hardware and same cloud service
software purchases (capex)
• Increased developer productivity
• Reductions in operational costs, • Improved customer satisfaction
backup, and disaster recovery
• Agile business processes that can
• Reduction in operations personnel quickly respond to new and
emerging opportunities
• Increase in global reach
Hard benefits include reduced spending on compute, storage, networking, and security. They also
include reductions in hardware and software purchases; reductions in operational costs, backup,
and disaster recovery; and a reduction in operations personnel.
Cloud Total Cost of Ownership defines what will be spent on the technology after adoption—or
what it costs to run the solution. Typically, a TCO analysis looks at the as-is on-premises
infrastructure and compares it with the cost of the to-be infrastructure state in the cloud. While
this difference might be easy to calculate, it might only provide a narrow view of the total
financial impact of moving to the cloud.
A return on investment (ROI) analysis can be used to determine the value that is generated while
considering spending and saving. This analysis starts by identifying the hard benefits in terms of
direct and visible cost reductions and efficiency improvements.
Next, soft savings are identified. Soft savings are value points that are challenging to accurately
quantify, but they can be more valuable than the hard savings. It is important for you to
understand both hard and soft benefits to understand the full value of the cloud. Soft benefits
include:
• Reusing service and applications that enable you to define (and redefine solutions) by using
the same cloud service
• Increased developer productivity
=== Page 30 ===
• Improved customer satisfaction
• Agile business processes that can quickly respond to new and emerging opportunities
• Increased global reach
Now, you will review a case study from Delaware North to see an actual TCO example.
=== Page 31 ===
Case study: Total Cost Of Ownership (1 of 6)
Background: • Growing global company with over 200 locations
• 500 million customers, $3 billion annual revenue
Background:
Delaware North originated in 1915 as a peanut and popcorn concessions vendor; today, it’s a
major food and hospitality company. Although the company deliberately keeps a low profile, it is
a leader in the food-service and hospitality industry.
Delaware North serves more than 500 million customers annually at more than 200 locations
around the world, including venues the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, London Heathrow
Airport, Kings Canyon Resort in Australia, and the Green Bay Packers’ Lambeau Field in Wisconsin.
This global presence has turned Delaware North into a $3 billion enterprise.
=== Page 32 ===
Case study: Total Cost of Ownership (2 of 6)
Background: • Growing global company with over 200 locations
• 500 million customers, $3 billion annual revenue
Challenge: • Meet demand to rapidly deploy new solutions
• Constantly upgrade aging equipment
The company’s on-premises data center was becoming too expensive and inefficient to support
its global business operations.
Kevin Quinlivan, Delaware North’s Chief Information Officer, said, “As the company continued to
grow, the demand to rapidly deploy new solutionsto meet customer requirements increased as
well. This fact, combined with the need to constantly upgrade aging equipment, required an
even greater commitment of resources on our part. We had to find a better strategy.”
Delaware North turned to AWS for a solution.
=== Page 33 ===
Case study: Total Cost of Ownership (3 of 6)
Background: • Growing global company with over 200 locations
• 500 million customers, $3 billion annual revenue
Challenge: • Meet demand to rapidly deploy new solutions
• Constantly upgrade aging equipment
Criteria: • Broad solution to handle all workloads
• Ability to modify processes to improve efficiency and lower costs
• Eliminate busy work (such as patching software)
• Achieve a positive return on investment (ROI)
After a successful migration of about 50 websites to AWS in 2013, Delaware North evaluated the
cost benefit and Total Cost of Ownership to move their IT infrastructure to AWS. Their focus was
to answer executive-level business demands for measurable benefits that could convince an
executive committee that the AWS Cloud was the right approach.
The evaluation process centered on three criteria:
• First, a cloud solution needed a broad set of technologies that could handle all of Delaware
North’s enterprise workloadswhile delivering support for critical functions.
• From an operational perspective, Delaware North wanted the features and flexibility to modify
core IT processes to improve efficiencies and lower costs. This included eliminating
redundant or time-consuming tasks like patching software or pushing test and development
tasks through outdated systems that, in the past, added months to the deployment of new
services.
• Finally, financial requirements needed to demonstrate a return on investment with a solid
cost-benefit justification for moving away from their existing data center environment.
=== Page 34 ===
Case study: Total Cost of Ownership (4 of 6)
Background: • Is a growing global company with over 200 locations
• Have 500 million customers, $3 billion (USD) annual revenue
Challenge: • Meet demand to rapidly deploy new solutions
• Constantly upgrade aging equipment
Criteria: • Have a broad solution to handle all workloads
• Be able to modify processes to improve efficiency and lower costs
• Eliminate busy work (such as patching software)
• Achieve a positive return on investment (ROI)
Solution: • Moved their on-premises data center to AWS
• Eliminated 205 servers (90 percent)
• Moved nearly all applications to AWS
• Used 3-year Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances
A cost comparison completed by Delaware North demonstrated that it could save $3.5 million US
dollars based on a 5-year run rate by moving its on-premises data center to AWSand using 3-
year Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances and Reserved Instance renewals.
Quinlivan noted that the deep technology stack available on AWS was more than sufficient to
meet the company’s technical and operational requirements. The pricing structure of the AWS
offerings—which includes paying only for what is used—provided total cost of ownership benefits
that were presented to senior leaders.
Quinlivan stated, “We compared the costs of keeping our on-premises data center versus moving
to the AWS Cloud, measuring basic infrastructure items such as hardware cost and maintenance.”
He also says “We estimate that moving to AWS will save us at least $3.5 million over five years by
reducing our server hardware by more than 90 percent. But the cost savings will likely be
greater due to additional benefits, like the increased compute capacity we can get using AWS.
That lets us continually add more and larger workloads than we could using a traditional data
center infrastructure, and achieve savings by only paying for what we use.”
Delaware North moved almost all of its applications to AWS, including enterprise software such
as its Fiorano middleware, Crystal Reports and QLIK business intelligence solutions, its Citrix
virtual desktop system, and Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager, which is used to
manage workstations.
=== Page 35 ===
The most dramatic physical change was the elimination of 205 servers. Everything that ran on that
hardware was migrated to AWS. The IT department decided to keep about 20 servers on-premises at
the new headquarters building to run communications and file-and-print tasks.
“We erred on the side of caution to ensure there is no latency with these tasks, but once we reach a
certain comfort level, we may move these to the cloud as well,” saidScott Mercer, head of the IT
department’s service-oriented architecture team.
=== Page 36 ===

This chart displays the cost comparison done by Delaware North showing the costs of their on-
premises environment and the proposed AWS environment. The estimates showed a $3.5 million
savings based on a five-year run rate by moving from an on-premises data center to AWS.

About 6 months into its cloud migration, Delaware North realized benefits in addition to its data
center consolidation, including cost-effective security compliance, enhanced disaster recovery,
and faster deployment times for new services.
“Robust security in a retail environment is critical for us because of our many retail operations,
and AWS is enormously helpful for that,” said Brian Mercer, the senior software architect for the
project. “By leveraging the security best practices of AWS, we’ve been able to eliminate a lot of
compliance tasks that in the past took up valuable time and money.”
Brian Mercer added that the company also increased its disaster recovery capabilities at a lower
cost than what was available in its previous data center deployment. “It significantly improved
our business continuity capabilities, including seamless failovers,” he said.
The solution is also helping Delaware North operate with greater speed and agility. For example,
it can bring in new businesses—either through contracts or acquisitions—and get them online
more quickly than in the past by eliminating the need for traditional IT procurement and
provisioning. It used to take between 2 and 3 weeks to provision new business units; now it takes
1 day. The Delaware North IT team is also using AWS to overhaul its operations by eliminating
outdated and cumbersome processes, cleaning up documentation, and using the benefits of
running test and development tasks in combination with rapid deployment of services through
the cloud.

“Our DevOps team can now spin up the resources to push out a service in just minutes, compared to
the weeks it used to take,” said Brian Mercer. “With AWS, we can respond much faster to business
needs. And we can start repurposing time and resources to deliver more value and services to our
internal teams and to our customers.”

Introduction to AWS Organizations
AWS Organizations
AWS Organizations is a free account management service that enables you to consolidate
multiple AWS accounts into anorganizationthat you create and centrally manage. AWS
Organizations include consolidated billing and account management capabilities that help you to
better meet the budgetary, security, and compliance needs of your business.
The main benefits of AWS Organizations are:
• Centrally managed access policies across multiple AWS accounts.
• Controlled access to AWS services.
• Automated AWS account creation and management.
• Consolidated billing across multiple AWS accounts.
=== Page 41 ===
AWS Organizations terminology
*Organizational Units (OUs)
Hereis some terminology to understand the structure of AWS Organizations.
The diagram shows a basic organization, or root, that consists of seven accounts that are
organized into four organizational units (or OUs). An OU is a container for accounts within a root.
An OU can also contain other OUs.This structure enables you to create a hierarchy that looks like
an upside-down tree with the root at the top.The branches consist of child OUs and they move
downward until they end in accounts,which are like the leaves of the tree.
When you attach a policy to one of the nodes in the hierarchy, it flows down and it affects all the
branches and leaves. This example organization has several policies that are attached to some of
the OUs or are attached directly to accounts.
An OU can have only one parent and, currently, each account can be a member of exactly one
OU. An account is a standard AWS account that contains your AWS resources. You can attach a
policy to an account to apply controls to only that one account.
=== Page 42 ===
Key features and benefits
Policy-based account management
Group based account management
Application programming interfaces
AWS (APIs) that automate account
Organizations management
Consolidated billing
AWS Organizations enablesyou to:
• Create service control policies (SCPs) that centrally control AWS services across multiple AWS
accounts.
• Create groups of accounts and then attach policies to a group to ensure that the correct
policies are applied across the accounts.
• Simplify account management by using application programming interfaces (APIs)to
automate the creation and management of new AWS accounts.
• Simplify the billing process by setting up a single payment method for all the AWS accounts in
your organization. With consolidated billing, you can see a combined view of charges that are
incurred by all your accounts, andyou cantakeadvantage of pricing benefits from aggregated
usage.Consolidated billing provides a central location to manage billing across all of your AWS
accounts, and the ability to benefit from volume discounts.

Security with AWS Organizations
Service control policies
Control access with IAM policies enable you (SCPs) enable you to
AWS Identity and to allow or deny access allow or deny access to
Access Management to AWS services for AWS services for
(IAM). users, groups, and individuals or group
roles. accounts in an
organizational unit
(OU).
AWS Organizations does not replace associating AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
policies with users, groups, and roles within an AWS account.
With IAM policies,you can allow or deny access to AWS services (such as Amazon S3), individual
AWS resources(such as a specific S3 bucket), or individual API actions(such as s3:CreateBucket).
An IAM policy can be applied only to IAM users, groups, or roles, and it can never restrict the
AWS account root user.
In contrast, with Organizations, you use service control policies (SCPs) to allow or deny access to
particular AWS services for individual AWS accounts or for groups of accounts in an OU. The
specified actions from an attached SCP affect all IAM users, groups, and roles for an account,
including the AWS account root user.

Keep in mind that this process assumes that you have access to two existing AWS accounts, and
that you can sign in to each accountas an administrator.
Reviewthese steps forsetting up AWS Organizations:
• Step 1 is to create your organization with your current AWS account as the primary account.
You also invite one AWS account to join your organization and create another account as a
member account.
• Step 2 is to create two organizational units in your new organization and place the member
accounts in those OUs.
• Step 3 is to create service control policies, which enable you to apply restrictions to what
actions can be delegated to users and roles in the member accounts. A service control policy is
a type of organization control policy.
• Step 4 is to test your organization’s policies. Sign in as a user for each of the roles (such as OU1
orOU2) and see how the service control policies impact account access. Alternatively, you can
use the IAM policy simulator to test and troubleshoot IAM and resource-based policies that
are attached to IAM users, groups, or roles in your AWS account.
To learn more about the IAM policy simulator, see the IAM policy simulator at
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_testing-policies.html.

Limits of AWS Organizations
There are restrictions on names that you can create in AWS Organizations,which includes names
of accounts, OUs, roots, and policies.
Names must be composed of Unicode characters and not exceed 250 characters in length.
AWS Organizations has several maximum and minimum values for entities.
For accessibility:List of the AWS Organizations limits, including names, number of accounts
(varies), number of roots (1), number of OUs(1,000), number of policies (1,000), max size of
control policy document (5,120 bytes), max nesting of BUs (5 levels of BUs under a root),
invitations sent per day (20), member accounts created concurrently (5), and entities to which
you can attach a policy (unlimited).End of accessibility description.

AWSOrganizations can be managed through different interfaces.
The AWSManagement Console is a browser-based interface that you can use to manage your
organization and your AWS resources. You can perform any task in your organization by using the
console.
AWS Command Line Interface(AWS CLI)toolsenable you to issue commands at your system's
command line to perform AWS Organizations tasks and AWS tasks. This method can be faster and
more convenient than using the console.
You can use also AWS software development kits (SDKs) to handletasks such as
cryptographically signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests automatically.AWS
SDKs consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms,such
as Java, Python, Ruby, .NET, iOS, and Android.
The AWS Organizations HTTPS Query API gives you programmatic access to AWS Organizations
and AWS. You can use the API to issue HTTPS requests directly to the service. When you use the
HTTPS API, you must include code to digitally sign requests by using your credentials.

Introducing Section 4: AWS Billing and Cost Management.
=== Page 48 ===
Introducing AWS Billing and Cost Management
AWS Billing and Cost Management is the service that you use to pay your AWS bill, monitor your
usage, and budget your costs. Billing and Cost Management enables you to forecast and obtain a
better idea of what your costs and usage might be in the future so that you can plan ahead.
You can set a custom time period and determine whether you would like to view your data at a
monthly or daily level of granularity.
With the filtering and grouping functionality, you can further analyze your data using a variety of
available dimensions. The AWS Cost and Usage Report Tool enables you to identify opportunities
for optimization by understandingyour cost and usage data trends and how you are using your
AWS implementation.
=== Page 49 ===
AWS Billing Dashboard
The AWS Billing Dashboard lets you view the status of your month-to-date AWS expenditure,
identify the services that account for the majority of your overall expenditure, and understand at
a high level how costs are trending.
One of the graphs that is located on the dashboard is the Spend Summary.The Spend Summary
shows you how much you spent last month, the estimated costs of your AWS usage for the
month to date, and a forecast for how much you are likely to spend this month.
Another graph is Month-to-Date Spend by Service,which shows the top services that you use
most and the proportion of costs thatare attributed to that service.
=== Page 50 ===
Tools
AWS Budgets AWS Cost and Usage Report AWS Cost Explorer
From the billing dashboard, you can access several other cost management tools that you can use
to estimate and plan your AWS costs.These tools include AWS Bills, AWS Cost Explorer, AWS
Budgets, and AWS Cost and Usage Reports.
=== Page 51 ===
Monthly bills
The AWS Bills page lists the costs that you incurred over the past month for each AWS service,
with a further breakdown by AWS Region and linked account.
This tool gives you access to the most up-to-date information on your costs and usage, including
your monthly bill and the detailed breakdown of the AWS services that you use.
=== Page 52 ===
Cost Explorer
The AWS Billing and Cost Management console includes the Cost Explorer page for viewing your
AWS cost data as a graph.
With Cost Explorer, you can visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over
time.
The Cost Explorer includes a default report that visualizes your costs and usage for your top cost-
incurring AWS services. The monthly running costs report gives you an overview of all your costs
for the past 3 months.It also provides forecasted numbers for the coming month, with a
corresponding confidence interval.
The Cost Explorer is a free tool that enables you to:
• View charts of your costs.
• View cost data for the past 13 months.
• Forecast how much you are likely to spend over the next 3 months.
• Discover patterns in how much you spend on AWS resources over time and identify cost
problem areas.
• Identify the services that you use the most
• View metrics, like which Availability Zones have the most traffic or which linked AWS account
is used the most.
=== Page 53 ===
Forecast and track costs
AWS Budgets uses the cost visualization that is provided by Cost Explorer to show you the status
of your budgets and to provide forecasts of your estimated costs.
You can also use AWS Budgets to create notifications forwhen you go over your budget for the
month,or when your estimated costs exceed your budget. Budgets can be tracked at the
monthly, quarterly, or yearly level, and you can customize the start and end dates. Budget alerts
can be sent via email or via Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS).
For accessibility:The AWS Billing budgets panel showing budget names, current and future costs
and usages, and headings for current and forecasted versus budgets. End of accessibility
description.

Cost and usage reporting
The AWS Cost and Usage Report is a single location for accessing comprehensive information
about your AWS costs and usage. This tool lists the usage for each service category that is used by
an account (and its users) in hourly or daily line items, and any tax that you activated for tax
allocation purposes.
You can choose to have AWS to publish billing reports to an S3 bucket. These reports can be
updated once a day.

Case severity and response times
It addition to understanding the costs that are associated with different support plans, it is critical
that you understand the service levels that are associated with each plan. In addition to the
support plan you select, the case severity will drive the type of response that you receive. There
are five different severitylevels:
• Critical–Your business is at risk. Critical functions of your application are unavailable.
• Urgent–Your business is significantly impacted. Important functions of your application are
unavailable.
• High –Important functions of your application are impaired or degraded.
• Normal–Non-critical functions of your application are behaving abnormally, or you have a
time-sensitive development question.
• Low–You have a general development question, or you want to request a feature.
Note that there is no case support with the Basic Support Plan. These response times should be
considered when you determine which support plan is best for your organization.
To learn more about AWS Support plans,see Compare AWS Support Plans at
https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/plans/.
