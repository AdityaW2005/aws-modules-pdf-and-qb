What is cloud computing?
What does cloud computing mean to you?
Take a moment to think of what cloud computing means to you and write a short sentence.
=== Page 9 ===
Cloud computing defined
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power,
database, storage, applications, and other IT resources via the
internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database, storage, applications,
and other IT resources via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. These resources run on server
computers that are located in large data centers in different locations around the world. When
you use a cloud service provider like AWS, that service provider owns the computers that you are
using. These resources can be used together like building blocks to build solutions that help meet
business goals and satisfy technology requirements.

Infrastructure as software
Cloud computing enables you to stop thinking of your infrastructure
as hardware, and instead think of (and use) it as software.
Cloud computing enables you to stop thinking of your infrastructure as hardware, and instead
think of (and use) it as software. But what does this mean?
=== Page 11 ===
Traditional computing model
• Infrastructure as hardware
• Hardware solutions:
• Require space, staff, physical
security, planning, capital
expenditure
• Have a long hardware
procurement cycle
• Require you to provision capacity
by guessing theoretical maximum
peaks
In the traditional computing model, infrastructure is thought of as hardware. Hardware solutions
are physical, which means they require space, staff, physical security, planning, and capital
expenditure.
In addition to significant upfront investment, another prohibitive aspect of traditional computing
is the long hardware procurement cycle that involves acquiring, provisioning, and maintaining on-
premises infrastructure.
With a hardware solution, you must ask if there is enough resource capacity or sufficient storage
to meet your needs, and you provision capacity by guessing theoretical maximum peaks. If you
don’t meet your projected maximum peak, then you pay for expensive resources that stay idle. If
you exceed your projected maximum peak, then you don’t have sufficient capacity to meet your
needs. And if your needs change, then you must spend the time, effort, and money required to
implement a new solution.
For example, if you wanted to provision a new website, you would need to buy the hardware,
rack and stack it, put it in a data center, and then manage it or have someone else manage it. This
approach is expensive and time-consuming.
=== Page 12 ===
Cloud computing model
• Infrastructure as software
• Software solutions:
• Are flexible
• Can change more quickly, easily,
and cost-effectively than hardware
solutions
• Eliminate the undifferentiated
heavy-lifting tasks
By contrast, cloud computing enables you to think of your infrastructure as software. Software
solutions are flexible. You can select the cloud services that best match your needs, provision and
terminate those resources on-demand, and pay for what you use. You can elastically scale
resources up and down in an automated fashion. With the cloud computing model, you can treat
resources as temporary and disposable. The flexibility that cloud computing offers enables
businesses to implement new solutions quickly and with low upfront costs.
Compared to hardware solutions, software solutions can change much more quickly, easily, and
cost-effectively.
Cloud computing helps developers and IT departments avoid undifferentiated work like
procurement, maintenance, and capacity planning, thus enabling them to focus on what matters
most.
As cloud computing has grown in popularity, several different service models and deployment
strategies have emerged to help meet the specific needs of different users. Each type of cloud
service model and deployment strategy provides you with a different level of control, flexibility,
and management. Understanding the differences between these cloud service models and
deployment strategies can help you decide what set of services is right for your needs.
=== Page 13 ===
Cloud service models
IaaS PaaS SaaS
(infrastructure as (platform as a (software as a
a service) service) service)
More control Less control
over IT resources over IT resources
There are three main cloud service models. Each model represents a different part of the cloud
computing stack and gives you a different level of control over your IT resources:
• Infrastructure as a service (IaaS):Services in this category are the basic building blocks for
cloud IT and typically provide you with access to networking features, computers (virtual or on
dedicated hardware), and data storage space. IaaS provides you with the highest level of
flexibility and management control over your IT resources. It is the most similar to existing IT
resources that many IT departments and developers are familiar with today.
• Platform as a service (PaaS): Services in this category reduce the need for you to manage the
underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems) and enable you to focus on
the deployment and management of your applications.
• Software as a service (SaaS):Services in this category provide you with a completed product
that the service provider runs and manages. In most cases, software as a service refers to end-
user applications. With a SaaS offering, you do not have to think about how the service is
maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed. You need to think only about
how you plan to use that particular piece of software. A common example of a SaaS
application is web-based email, where you can send and receive email without managing
feature additions to the email product or maintaining the servers and operating systems that
the email program runs on.
=== Page 14 ===
Cloud computing deployment models
Cloud Hybrid On-premises
(private cloud)
There are three main cloud computing deployment models, which represent the cloud
environments that your applications can be deployed in:
• Cloud: A cloud-based application is fully deployed in the cloud, and all parts of the application
run in the cloud. Applications in the cloud have either been created in the cloud or have been
migrated from an existing infrastructure to take advantage of the benefits of cloud computing
(see https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-computing/). Cloud-based applications can be
built on low-level infrastructure pieces or they can use higher-level services that provide
abstraction from the management, architecting, and scaling requirements of core
infrastructure.
• Hybrid: A hybrid deployment is a way to connect infrastructure and applications between
cloud-based resources and existing resources that are not located in the cloud. The most
common method of hybrid deployment is between the cloud and existing on-premises
infrastructure. This model enables an organization to extend and grow their infrastructure into
the cloud while connecting cloud resources to internal systems.
• On-premises: Deploying resources on-premises, using virtualization and resource
management tools, is sometimes called private cloud. While on-premises deployment does
not provide many of the benefits of cloud computing, it is sometimes sought for its ability to
provide dedicated resources. In most cases, this deployment model is the same as legacy IT
infrastructure, but it might also use application management and virtualization technologies to
increase resource utilization.

There are many similarities between AWS and the traditional, on-premises IT space:
• AWS security groups, network access control lists (network ACLs), and AWS Identity and
Access Management (IAM) are similar to firewalls, access control lists (ACLs), and
administrators.
• Elastic Load Balancing and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) are similar to routers,
network pipelines, and switches.
• Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances
are similar to on-premises servers.
• Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS), Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS), Amazon
Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), and Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)
are similar to direct attached storage (DAS), storage area networks (SAN), network attached
storage (NAS), and a relational database management service (RDBMS).
With AWS services and features, you can do almost everything that you would want to do with a
traditional data center.

Section 2: Advantages of cloud
computing
Section 2: Advantages of cloud computing
Why are so many companies interested in moving to the cloud? This section presents six
advantages of cloud computing.
=== Page 18 ===
Trade capital expense for variable expense
Capital
Data center investment Pay only for the amount
you consume
based on forecast
Advantage #1—Trade capital expense for variable expense: Capital expenses (capex) are funds
that a company uses to acquire, upgrade, and maintain physical assets such as property,
industrial buildings, or equipment. Do you remember the data center example in the traditional
computing model where you needed to rack and stack the hardware, and then manage it all? You
must pay for everything in the data center whether you use it or not.
By contrast, a variable expense is an expense that the person who bears the cost can easily alter
or avoid. Instead of investing heavily in data centers and servers before you know how you will
use them, you can pay only when you consume resources and pay only for the amount you
consume. Thus, you save money on technology. It also enables you to adapt to new applications
with as much space as you need in minutes, instead of weeks or days. Maintenance is reduced,
so you can spend focus more on the core goals of your business.
=== Page 19 ===
Massive economies of scale
Because of aggregate usage from all customers, AWS can achieve
higher economies of scale and pass savings on to customers.
AWS Cloud
Economies of scale Savings
Advantage #2—Benefit from massive economies of scale: By using cloud computing, you can
achieve a lower variable cost than you can get on your own. Because usage from hundreds of
thousands of customers is aggregated in the cloud, providers such as AWS can achieve higher
economies of scale, which translates into lower pay-as-you-go prices.
=== Page 20 ===
Stop guessing capacity
Overestimated Underestimated Scaling on
server capacity demand
server capacity
Advantage #3—Stop guessing capacity: Eliminate guessing about your infrastructure capacity
needs. When you make a capacity decision before you deploy an application, you often either
have expensive idle resources or deal with limited capacity. With cloud computing, these
problems go away. You can access as much or as little as you need, and scale up and down as
required with only a few minutes’ notice.
=== Page 21 ===
Increase speed and agility
Launch
Weeks between wanting Minutes between wanting
resources and having resources resources and having
resources
Advantage #4—Increase speed and agility: In a cloud computing environment, new IT resources
are only a click away, which means that you reduce the time it takes to make those resources
available to your developers from weeks to just minutes. The result is a dramatic increase in
agility for the organization because the cost and time that it takes to experiment and develop are
significantly lower.
=== Page 22 ===
Stop spending money on
running and maintaining data centers
Investment
Running data centers Business and customers
Advantage #5—Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers: Focus on
projects that differentiate your business instead of focusing on the infrastructure. Cloud
computing enables you to focus on your own customers instead of the heavy lifting of racking,
stacking, and powering servers.
=== Page 23 ===
Go global in minutes
Advantage #6—Go global in minutes: You can deploy your application in multiple AWS Regions
around the world with just a few clicks. As a result, you can provide a lower latency and better
experience for your customers simply and at minimal cost.

What are web services?
A web service is any piece of software that makes itself available over
the internet and uses a standardized format—such as Extensible
Markup Language (XML) or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)—for
the request and the response of an application programming
interface (API) interaction.
Request message
Internet

Client Web service
In general, a web service is any piece of software that makes itself available over the internet or
on private (intranet) networks. A web service uses a standardized format—such as Extensible
Markup Language (XML) or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)—for the request and the response
of an application programming interface (API) interaction. It is not tied to any one operating
system or programming language. It’s self-describing via an interface definition file and it is
discoverable.
=== Page 27 ===
What is AWS?
• AWS is a secure cloud platform that offers a broad set of global
cloud-based products.
• AWS provides you with on-demand access to compute, storage,
network, database, and other IT resources and management tools.
• AWS offers flexibility.
• You pay only for the individual services you need, for as long as
you use them.
• AWS services work together like building blocks.
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a secure cloud platform that offers a broad set of global cloud-
based products. Because these products are delivered over the internet, you have on-demand
access to the compute, storage, network, database, and other IT resources that you might need
for your projects—and the tools to manage them. You can immediately provision and launch AWS
resources. The resources are ready for you to use in minutes.
AWS offers flexibility. Your AWS environment can be reconfigured and updated on demand,
scaled up or down automatically to meet usage patterns and optimize spending, or shut down
temporarily or permanently. The billing for AWS services becomes an operational expense
instead of a capital expense.
AWS services are designed to work together to support virtually any type of application or
workload. Think of these services like building blocks, which you can assemble quickly to build
sophisticated, scalable solutions, and then adjust them as your needs change.

AWS services fall under different categories, and each category contains one or more services.
You can select the services that you want from these different categories to build your solutions.
=== Page 29 ===
Simple solution example
Networking Compute Database Storage
AWS Cloud
Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
Amazon
DynamoDB
Users
Amazon S3
Amazon EC2
For example, say you’re building a database application. Your customers might be sending data to
your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, which is a service in the compute
category. These EC2 servers batch the data in one-minute increments and add an object per
customer to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), the AWS storage service you’ve chosen
to use. You can then use a nonrelational database like Amazon DynamoDB to power your
application, for example, to build an index so that you can find all the objects for a given
customer that were collected over a certain period. You might decide to run these services inside
an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), which is a service in the networking category.
The purpose of this simple example is to illustrate that you can select web services from different
categories and use them together to build a solution (in this case, a database application). Of
course, the solutions you build can be quite complex.
=== Page 30 ===
Choosing a service
The service you select depends on your business goals and technology
requirements.

Which service you choose to use will depend on your business goals and technology
requirements. In the example you just looked at, the solution made use of Amazon EC2 as the
compute service. However, that is only one of many compute services that AWS offers. Here are
some other AWS compute offerings that you might choose to use for the following example use
cases:
• Amazon EC2(https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/): You want complete control over your AWS
computing resources.
• AWS Lambda (https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/): You want to run your code and not manage
or provision servers.
• AWS Elastic Beanstalk (https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/): You want a service that
deploys, manages, and scales your web applications for you.
• Amazon Lightsail(https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/): You need a lightweight cloud platform
for a simple web application.
• AWS Batch (https://aws.amazon.com/batch/): You need to run hundreds of thousands of batch
workloads.
• AWS Outposts (https://aws.amazon.com/outposts/): You want to run AWS infrastructure in
your on-premises data center.
• Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) (https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/)
• Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) (https://aws.amazon.com/eks/)
• AWS Fargate(https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/): You want to implement a containers or
microservices architecture.
• VMware Cloud on AWS (https://aws.amazon.com/vmware/): You have an on-premises server
virtualization platform that you want to migrate to AWS.
Similarly, there are a variety of services for you to choose from in the other categories, and the
number of offerings keeps growing.

Three ways to interact with AWS
AWS Management Console
Easy-to-use graphical interface
Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)
Access to services by discrete commands or scripts
Software Development Kits (SDKs)
Access services directly from your code (such as Java, Python, and
others)
You might wonder how to access the broad array of services that are offered by AWS. There are
three ways to create and manage resources on the AWS Cloud:
• AWS Management Console: The console provides a rich graphical interface to a majority of
the features offered by AWS. (Note: From time to time, new features might not have all of
their capabilities included in the console when the feature initially launches.)
• AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI): The AWS CLI provides a suite of utilities that can be
launched from a command script in Linux, macOS, or Microsoft Windows.
• Software development kits (SDKs): AWS provides packages that enable accessing AWS in a
variety of popular programming languages. This makes it easy to use AWS in your existing
applications and it also enables you to create applications that deploy and monitor complex
systems entirely through code.
All three options are built on a common REST-like API that serves as the foundation of AWS.

Section 4: Moving to the AWS
Cloud – The AWS Cloud Adoption
Framework (AWS CAF)
Section 4: Moving to the AWS Cloud –The AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF)
As you learned so far in this module, cloud computing offers many advantages over the
traditional model. However, for most organizations, cloud adoption does not happen instantly.
Technology is one thing, but an organization also consists of people and processes, and these
three elements must all be in alignment for successful cloud adoption. Cloud computing
introduces a significant shift in how technology is obtained, used, and managed. It also shifts how
organizations budget and pay for technology services. Cloud adoption requires that fundamental
changes are discussed and considered across an entire organization. It also requires that
stakeholders across all organizational units—both within and outside IT—support these new
changes. In this last section, you learn about the AWS CAF, which was created to help
organizations design and travel an accelerated path to successful cloud adoption.
=== Page 35 ===
AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF)
• AWS CAF provides guidance
and best practices to help
organizations build a
comprehensive approach to
cloud computing across the
organization and throughout
the IT lifecycle to accelerate
successful cloud adoption.
AWS CAF perspectives
• AWS CAF is organized into six
perspectives.
• Perspectives consist of sets of
capabilities.
Each organization’s cloud adoption journey is unique. However, in order for any organization to
successfully migrate its IT portfolio to the cloud, three elements (that is, people, process, and
technology) must be in alignment. Business and technology leaders in an organization must
understand the organization’s current state, target state, and the transition that is needed to
achieve the target state so they can set goals and create processes for staff.
The AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF) provides guidance and best practices to help
organizations identify gaps in skills and processes. It also helps organizations build a
comprehensive approach to cloud computing—both across the organization and throughout the
IT lifecycle—to accelerate successful cloud adoption.
At the highest level, the AWS CAF organizes guidance into six areas of focus, called perspectives.
Perspectives span people, processes, and technology. Each perspective consists of a set of
capabilities, which covers distinct responsibilities that are owned or managed by functionally
related stakeholders.
Capabilities within each perspective are used to identify which areas of an organization require
attention. By identifying gaps, prescriptive work streams can be created that support a successful
cloud journey.
=== Page 36 ===
Six core perspectives
Focus on business Focus on technical
capabilities capabilities
In general, the Business, People, and Governance perspectives focus on business capabilities,
while the Platform, Security, and Operations perspectives focus on technical capabilities.

Business perspective capabilities managers, budget owners,
and strategy stakeholders
Stakeholders from the Business perspective (for example, business managers, finance managers,
budget owners, and strategy stakeholders) can use the AWS CAF to create a strong business case
for cloud adoption and prioritize cloud adoption initiatives. Stakeholders should ensure that an
organization’s business strategies and goals align with its IT strategies and goals.
=== Page 38 ===
People perspective
We must prioritize training, staffing, and
organizational changes to build an agile
organization.
Resource management
Incentive management
Career management

People perspective capabilities
Stakeholders from the People perspective (for example, human resources, staffing, and people
managers) can use the AWS CAF to evaluate organizational structures and roles, new skill and
process requirements, and identify gaps. Performing an analysis of needs and gaps can help
prioritize training, staffing, and organizational changes to build an agile organization.
=== Page 39 ===
Governance perspective
We must ensure that skills and processes align IT
strategy and goals with business strategy and goals
so the organization can maximize the business value

Stakeholders from the Governance perspective (for example, the Chief Information Officer or CIO,
program managers, enterprise architects, business analysts, and portfolio managers) can use the
AWS CAF to focus on the skills and processes that are needed to align IT strategy and goals with
business strategy and goals. This focus helps the organization maximize the business value of its
IT investment and minimize the business risks.

Platform perspective capabilities
Stakeholders from the Platform perspective (for example, Chief Technology Officer or CTO, IT
managers, and solutions architects) use a variety of architectural dimensions and models to
understand and communicate the nature of IT systems and their relationships. They must be able
to describe the architecture of the target state environment in detail. The AWS CAF includes
principles and patterns for implementing new solutions on the cloud, and for migrating on-
premises workloads to the cloud.
