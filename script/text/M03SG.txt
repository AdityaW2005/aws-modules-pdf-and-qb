Demo: AWS Global
Infrastructure
Details
The educator might now choose to conduct a live demonstration of the AWS Global
Infrastructure map introduced on the previous slide. This resource provides an interactive way to
learn about the AWS Global Infrastructure. The remaining slides in this section cover many of the
same topics and go into greater detail on some topics.

AWS Regions
• An AWS Region is a geographical area.
• Data replication across Regions is
controlled by you.
• Communication between Regions uses
AWS backbone network infrastructure.
• Each Region provides full redundancy and
connectivity to the network.
• A Region typically consists of two or more
Availability Zones.
Example: London Region
The AWS Cloud infrastructure is built around Regions. AWS has 22 Regions worldwide. An AWS
Regionis a physical geographical location with one or more Availability Zones. Availability Zones
in turn consist of one or more data centers.
To achieve fault tolerance and stability, Regions are isolated from one another. Resources in one
Region are not automatically replicated to other Regions. When you store data in a specific
Region, it is not replicated outside that Region.
It is your responsibility to replicate data across Regions, if your business needs require it.
AWS Regions that were introduced before March 20, 2019 are enabled by default. Regions that
were introduced after March 20, 2019—such as Asia Pacific (Hong Kong) and Middle East
(Bahrain)—are disabled by default. You must enable these Regions before you can use them. You
can use the AWS Management Console to enable or disable a Region.
Some Regions have restricted access. An Amazon AWS (China) account provides access to the
Beijing and Ningxia Regions only. To learn more about AWS in China, see:
https://www.amazonaws.cn/en/about-aws/china/. The isolated AWS GovCloud (US) Region is
designed to allow US government agencies and customers to move sensitive workloads into the
cloud by addressing their specific regulatory and compliance requirements.
For accessibility:Snapshot from the infrastructure.awswebsite that shows a picture of
downtown London including the Tower Bridge and the Shard. It notes that there are three
Availability Zones in the London region. End of accessibility description.

for your services,

applications, and data based
on these factors
Costs (vary by Region)
There are a few factors that you should consider when you select the optimal Region or Regions
where you store data and use AWS services.
One essential consideration is data governance and legal requirements. Local laws might require
that certain information be kept within geographical boundaries. Such laws might restrict the
Regions where you can offer content or services. For example, consider the European Union (EU)
Data Protection Directive.
All else being equal, it is generally desirable to run your applications and store your data in a
Region that is as close as possible to the user and systems that will access them. This will help
you reduce latency. CloudPing is one website that you can use to test latency between your
location and all AWS Regions. To learn more about CloudPing, see: http://www.cloudping.info/
Keep in mind that not all services are available in all Regions. To learn more, see:
https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-
services/?p=tgi&loc=4.
Finally, there is some variation in the cost of running services, which can depend on which Region
you choose. For example, as of this writing, running an On-Demand t3.medium size Amazon
Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) Linux instance in the US East (Ohio) Region costs $0.0416
per hour, but running the same instance in the Asia Pacific (Tokyo) Region costs $0.0544 per hour.

Availability Zones
• Each Regionhas multiple Availability Zones.
AWS Cloud
• Each Availability Zone is a fully isolated
Region eu-west-1
partition of the AWS infrastructure.
Availability Zone eu-west-1a
• Availability Zones consist of discrete data centers
Data center
• They are designed for fault isolation
Data center
• They are interconnected with other Availability Zones
by using high-speed private networking Data center
• You choose your Availability Zones.
Availability Zone eu-west-1b
• AWS recommends replicating data and resources
across Availability Zones for resiliency.
Availability Zone eu-west-1c
Each AWS Region has multiple, isolated locations that are known as Availability Zones.
Each Availability Zone provides the ability to operate applications and databases that are more
highly available, fault-tolerant, and scalable than would be possible with a single data center.
Each Availability Zone can include multiple data centers (typically three), and at full-scale, they
can include hundreds of thousands of servers. They are fully isolated partitions of the AWS Global
Infrastructure. Availability Zones have their own power infrastructure, and they are physically
separated by many kilometers from other Availability Zones—though all Availability Zones are
within 100 km of each other.
All Availability Zones are interconnected with high-bandwidth, low-latency networking over fully
redundant, dedicated fiber that provides high-throughput between Availability Zones. The
network accomplishes synchronous replication between Availability Zones.
Availability Zones help build highly available applications. When an application is partitioned
across Availability Zones, companies are better isolated and protected from issues such as
lightning, tornadoes, earthquakes, and more.
You are responsible for selecting the Availability Zones where your systems will reside. Systems
can span multiple Availability Zones. AWS recommends replicating across Availability Zones for
resiliency. You should design your systems to survive the temporary or prolonged failure of an
=== Page 13 ===
Availability Zone if a disaster occurs.

AWS data centers
• AWS data centers are designed for
security.
• Data centers are where the data
resides and data processing occurs.
• Each data center has redundant
power, networking, and connectivity,
and is housed in a separate facility.
• A data center typically has 50,000 to
80,000 physical servers.
The foundation for the AWS infrastructure is the data centers. Customers do not specify a data
center for the deployment of resources. Instead, an Availability Zone is the most granular level of
specification that a customer can make. However, a data center is the location where the actual
data resides. Amazon operates state-of-the-art, highly available data centers. Although rare,
failures can occur that affect the availability of instances in the same location. If you host all your
instances in a single location that is affected by such a failure, none of your instances will be
available.
Data centers are securely designed with several factors in mind:
Each location is carefully evaluated to mitigate environmental risk.
• Data centers have a redundant design that anticipates and tolerates failure while maintaining
service levels.
• To ensure availability, critical system components are backed up across multiple Availability
Zones.
• To ensure capacity, AWS continuously monitors service usage to deploy infrastructure to
support availability commitments and requirements.
• Data center locations are not disclosed and all access to them is restricted.
• In case of failure, automated processes move data traffic away from the affected area.
AWS uses custom network equipment sourced from multiple original device manufacturers
(ODMs).ODMs design and manufacture products based on specifications from a second
company. The second company then rebrands the products for sale.
=== Page 15 ===
Points of Presence
• AWS provides a global
network of Points of Presence
locations
• Consists of edge locations
and a much smaller number
of Regional edge caches
• Used with Amazon
CloudFront
• A global Content Delivery Network
(CDN), that delivers content to end
users withreduced latency
• Regional edge caches used for
content with infrequent
access.
Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) used to distribute content to end users
to reduce latency. Amazon Route 53 is a Domain Name System (DNS) service. Requests going to
either one of these services will be routed to the nearest edge location automatically in order to
lower latency.
AWS Points of Presence are located in most of the major cities around the world. By
continuously measuring internet connectivity, performance and computing to find the best
way to route requests,the Points of Presence deliver a better near real-time user experience.
They are used by many AWS services, including Amazon CloudFront, Amazon Route 53, AWS
Shield, and AWS Web Application Firewall (AWS WAF) services.
Regional edge caches are used by default with Amazon CloudFront. Regional edge caches are
used when you have content that is not accessed frequently enough to remain in an edge
location. Regional edge caches absorb this content and provide an alternative to that content
having to be fetched from the origin server.

Now that you have a good understanding of the major components that comprise the AWS
Global Infrastructure, let's consider the benefits provided by this infrastructure.
The AWS Global Infrastructure has several valuable features:
• First, it is elasticand scalable. This means resources can dynamically adjust to increases or
decreases in capacity requirements. It can also rapidly adjust to accommodate growth.
• Second, this infrastructure is fault tolerant, which means it has built-in component
redundancy which enables it to continue operations despite a failed component.
• Finally, it requires minimal to no human intervention, while providing high availability with
minimal down time.
=== Page 17 ===
Key takeaways • The AWS Global Infrastructure consists of
Regions and Availability Zones.
• Your choice of a Regionis typically based on
compliance requirements or to reduce latency.
• Each Availability Zone is physically separate from
other Availability Zones and has redundant
power, networking, and connectivity.
• Edge locations, and Regionaledge caches
improve performance by caching content closer
to users.
Some key takeaways from this section of the module include:
• The AWS Global Infrastructure consists of Regions and Availability Zones.
• Your choice of a Region is typically based on compliance requirements or to reduce latency.
• Each Availability Zone is physically separate from other Availability Zones and has redundant

AWS offers a broad set of cloud-based services. There are 23 different product or service
categories, and each category consists of one or more services. This course will not attempt to
introduce you to each service. Rather, the focus of this course is on the services that are most
widely used and offer the best introduction to the AWS Cloud. This course also focuses on
services that are more likely to be covered in the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam.
The categories that this course will discuss are highlighted on the slide: Compute, Cost
Management, Database, Management and Governance, Networking and Content Delivery,
Security, Identity, and Compliance, and Storage.
To learn more about AWS products, see Cloud Products at https://aws.amazon.com/products/.
All AWS products are organized into the service categories that are shown here. For example, if
you click Compute,you will see that Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is first on the
list. The compute category also lists many other products and services.
If you click Amazon EC2,it takes you to the Amazon EC2 page. Each product page provides a
detailed description of the product and lists some of its benefits.
Explore the different service groups to understand the categories and services within them. Now
that you know how to locate information about different services, this module will discuss the
highlighted service categories. The next seven slides list the individual services —within each of
the categories highlighted above—that this course will discuss.

2. Explore the AWS Management Console.
A. Click the Servicesmenu.
B. Notice how services are grouped into service categories. For example, the EC2service appears in the Compute
service category.
Question #1: Under which service category does the IAM service appear?
Question #2: Under which service category does the AmazonVPCservice appear?
C. Click the AmazonVPCservice. Notice that the dropdown menu in the top-right corner displays an AWS Region (for
example, it might display N. Virginia).
D. Click the Region menu and switch to a different Region. For example, choose EU (London).
E. Click Subnets(on the left side of the screen). The Region has three subnets in it. Click the box next to one of the
subnets. Notice that the bottom half of the screen now displays details about this subnet.
Question #3: Does the subnet you selected exist at the level of the Region or at the level of the Availability
Zone?
F. Click Your VPCs. An existing VPC is already selected.
Question #4: Does the VPC exist at the level of the Region or the level of the Availability Zone?
Question #5: Which services are global instead of Regional? Check Amazon EC2, IAM, Lambda, and Route 53.
The purpose of this activity is to expose you to the AWS Management Console. You will gain
experience navigating between AWS service consoles (such as the Amazon VPC console). You will
also practice navigating to services in different service categories. Finally, the console will help
