# üìò How to Download Protected PDFs from AWS Academy (Content Controller)

Sometimes AWS Academy course materials (like **Student Guides**) open inside a web viewer and don‚Äôt provide a download button. If you try to copy the PDF link directly, you‚Äôll see this error:

> **Content can only be accessed by the launch process. Please launch your course again.**

This happens because the PDF requires **authenticated session cookies** from Canvas/LTI launch.
Here‚Äôs how you can still download the PDF for **personal offline use**.

   * `Ctrl + Shift + I` (Windows/Linux) or
   * `Cmd + Option + I` (Mac)
     to open **Developer Tools**.
